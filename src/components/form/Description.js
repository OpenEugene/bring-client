        <p>Here at BRING, we get hundreds of donations each month. 
            We wish we could accept every donation but there are some 
            items we cannot accept. Before coming in, upload a photo 
            of the items you would like to donate with a brief description. 
            Our staff will reach out to you to confirm if we can take the 
            item or not.</p>
